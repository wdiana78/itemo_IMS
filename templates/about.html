                    ITEMO IMS is a web based inventory management system designed for stock heavy teams
                    across different industries. Instead of scattered spreadsheets and manual follow ups,
                    your managers get one place to see items, quantities, locations, and stock status for
                    projects, branches, and departments.

                <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                    Many small and medium organisations manage materials using ad hoc methods:
                    separate spreadsheets, messaging apps, and paper notes. As work grows,
                    it becomes difficult to answer basic questions with confidence and speed.

                <ul class="small text-muted mb-0">
                    <li>Unclear which items are low or fully out of stock in each location.</li>
                    <li>Hard to trace what was delivered, to which project or branch, and when.</li>
                    <li>No single place to review supplier performance or follow up on pending payments.</li>
