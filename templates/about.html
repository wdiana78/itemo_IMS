                    ITEMO IMS is a web based inventory management system designed to help
                    construction and stock heavy teams keep clear, reliable records. Instead of
                    scattered spreadsheets and guesswork, managers get one place to see items,
                    quantities, and stock status.

                <p class="small text-muted mb-2">
                    Many small and medium teams manage materials using ad-hoc methods:
                    separate spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, and paper notes. As the work
                    grows, it becomes difficult to answer basic questions with confidence.

                <ul class="small text-muted mb-0">
                    <li>Unclear which items are low or fully out of stock.</li>
